# SMART CALCULATOR AND VOICE CALCULATOR (WIP)
This README file provides an overview of the Smart Calculator and Voice Calculator, a Python application with a user interface built using the Tkinter library.

# Features:
  - Basic mathematical operations
  - User Interface
  - voice calculator (under development)
# Basic mathematical operations:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, roots, logarithms, factorials.
- Scientific notations: Display results in scientific notation format when appropriate.
- Trigonometric functions: Calculate sine, cosine, tangent with optional angle unit conversion (degrees and radians).
- Hyperbolic functions: Calculate hyperbolic sine, cosine, and tangent.
- Memory functions: Clear (C), Clear Entry (CE), and Equal (=).
- Additional functions: Pi (π), 2π, Euler's number (e), base-2 logarithm (ln), base-10 logarithm (log₁₀).
- Voice Recognition (WIP):

The _"SMART"_ in the title indicates plans for future integration of voice recognition capabilities. This functionality is currently a work in progress and not yet implemented in this version.

# Getting Started:

Install Python: Make sure you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) installed on your system.
Install Tkinter:
Run: [pip install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/#get-pip-py)

in your terminal to install the Tkinter library.
Run the script: Save the code as smart_calculator.py and run it using python smart_calculator.py.


 # User Interface:

The calculator has a user-friendly interface with buttons for numbers, operators, and functions.
A display field shows the entered expression and the calculated result.
A logo and a microphone button are included for visual appeal (microphone functionality is not yet available).
Note:

This is a basic version of the calculator and can be further enhanced with additional features like history, error handling, more advanced scientific functions, and improved voice recognition integration.

# Future Plans:

- Implement voice recognition functionality for a truly smart calculator experience.
- Add more scientific functions like permutations, combinations, absolute values, etc.
- Enhance the user interface with customizable settings and themes.
- Implement error handling to provide feedback for invalid input.
- Add a history function to review past calculations.
# Feedback and Contributions:

We welcome your feedback and suggestions for improvement. Feel free to contribute to the project by submitting pull requests with your ideas and implementations.

Thank you for using the Smart Calculator and Voice Calculator!
